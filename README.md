# Impact of Party Leadership on Donation Patterns

## Overview

This research project "Impact of Federal Party Leadership Changes on Donation Patterns" explores how leadership changes within federal and Ontario political parties affect donation behaviors from individual donors across Canada. By analyzing patterns in political contributions, I aim to understand the influence of leadership transitions on political financing.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, ChatGpt. The entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
